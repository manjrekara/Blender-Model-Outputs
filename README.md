# Blender-Model-Outputs

In this repository you will find Blender outputs for several models that we used for our senior design project. All files are for a model walking through a 3 meter long corridor within a Blender scene. Here, a radar/depth camera is able to capture the model from the left as it walks through the corridor. 

All images represent the frames as captured from the 3 meter corridor. 

Through this simulation we are able to get material images, clothed images, and unclothed images:
